                Sports clubs are one of the dominant sports delivery mechanisms in New Zealand, yet despite this,
                they have received remarkably little attention in the academic literature. This study aims to fill that
                gap through a case study investigation of the governance structures and processes used by four
                small sports clubs in New Zealand. Drawing on a case study approach utilising interviews and
                documentary evidence, the study found that small sports clubs in New Zealand are mostly governed,
                managed and operated by a group of dedicated volunteers elected or appointed to the committee
                by their fellow members

    The governance structures that small clubs operate within has evolved
    from the historical ‘kitchen table’ method of operation to a hybrid model of multiple governance
    models and ideas. Unexpectedly, the study found that these ideas have in most cases come from the
    knowledge volunteers bring to the committee table, or borrowed from other clubs that are deemed
    successful, as opposed to utilising well documented models such as Carver's (2006) Policy
    Governance Model or Sport New Zealand’s The Nine Steps to Effective Governance (Sport New
    Zealand, 2014).
